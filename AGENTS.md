# Repository guide

The owner retired this fitness project on 27 September 2026. Preserve this archive. Earlier implementation instructions below are historical and do not authorize resuming development or deploying to kinetexa.com. Read `docs/retirement.md` before any restoration.

- Build the complete V1 described in `docs/sources/`; the PRD defines requirements and the strategy brief explains the product. Later explicit user decisions override either document. Track changes in `docs/decisions.md`; never silently drop scope.
- Keep implementation simple. Prefer maintained, compatible open-source libraries over rebuilding proven functionality. Check licenses and reuse only what fits.
- Test where failure matters: authorization, private data, imports, calculations, payments and destructive operations. Prefer API/integration checks for behavior; use browsers mainly to review desktop/mobile UI, accessibility and the few essential user journeys. Avoid redundant or implementation-mirroring tests.
- Make the interface distinctive, friendly and clear on desktop and mobile. Follow `docs/design-direction.md` and verify real layouts.
- Use focused Conventional Commits and `codex/` branches when useful. Use SemVer prerelease tags for milestones, keep `CHANGELOG.md` current, and push coherent verified changes. Reserve `v1.0.0` for operational, verified V1.
- Keep secrets and personal setup notes out of Git. Use private defaults and server authorization. Record incomplete integrations honestly; never substitute fake data or claim an unverified launch.
- Do not upgrade Vercel. Resend is free-tier only. Prefer APIs/CLIs for setup; use signed-in dashboards when necessary. Respect the requested phase boundaries in `docs/decisions.md`.
