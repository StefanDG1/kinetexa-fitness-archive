# Changelog

## Retired, 27 September 2026

Archived the fitness project and reserved its code/history and existing license for recovery. The owner reassigned the Kinetexa name and domain to a separate publication. See `docs/retirement.md`. No new application release is claimed.

## Unreleased

## 0.5.0-alpha.4 - 2026-09-07

Installation and account-action milestone. Production remains closed.

- Limit profile changes before they can schedule repeated recalculation. Make confirmed logout idempotent across WorkOS requests and bound failed-provider retries without reopening private access.
- Complete PWA manifest/icons and install help. Cache only a public reconnect page and icons; verify Chrome installability, unavailable-server navigation and reconnection in a local production build without hosted data tests.

## 0.5.0-alpha.3 - 2026-09-07

Functional journey milestone. Production remains closed.

- Use server time for equipment creation and completed service to avoid rejecting valid actions when the browser clock is ahead. Preserve historical service baselines on edits.
- Keep every equipment card visible while editing a reminder and show planned workout start times on calendar cards.
- Verify the import-to-dashboard, activity inspection/editing, selected-field sharing/revocation, saved analysis, goal, calendar and equipment/service workflows with one 4,290-byte synthetic recording. Record the remaining acceptance and external dependencies explicitly.

## 0.5.0-alpha.2 - 2026-09-07

Contributor and operational milestone. Production remains closed.

- Attach bounded processing and AI phase timings to existing operational events, export parent/child OTLP spans, add opt-in collector delivery and phase failure/latency alerts without per-phase database writes.
- Expose saved-analysis measurement coverage and contributing activities; preserve query date controls and suppress stale results after filter changes.
- Skip activity-history reads for health-only calculations and reject malformed share links before a backend request.

- Add current contributor/local-development guides, a local configuration checker, and synthetic-data issue/PR templates. Keep standalone Open Solo limitations explicit.
- Select backend environment files explicitly and pipe secret values through stdin in the configuration sync helper.

## 0.5.0-alpha.1 - 2026-09-07

Functional interface milestone. Production remains closed; authenticated browser acceptance and external release gates remain open.

- Replace the global full-history subscription with page-specific, manually paginated reads. Dashboard, goals, records and gear use deterministic backend calculations with explicit refresh.
- Expose interval calculations, canonical downloads, complete provenance pagination, AI feedback and server-generated share totals.
- Add goal, plan, privacy-zone and saved-analysis editing/deletion, analysis copies and pinning, named maintenance reminders and service history. Preserve legacy reminder baselines during conversion.
- Preserve running FTP and use profile-timezone calendar dates, including daylight-saving transitions, for plans, goals, filters and expiry.
- Correct individual gear grouping and missing numeric filters. Render pinned number/table analyses and current calculation explanations.

## 0.4.0-alpha.8 - 2026-09-07

Verified duration, large FIT import, history pagination and duplicate-decision milestone. Production registration remains closed; V1 release gates remain open.

- Explain duplicate suggestions, persist keep-separate decisions and expose retained merged recordings through bounded provenance navigation; preserve originals, edits and history through merge/undo.

- Decode FIT once per import/reprocessing job and release consumed records during canonical validation; verify a hosted 48-hour, 172,801-sample recording without changing source data or calculated results.

- Bound activity, import and health pagination by bytes as well as row count; verify complete traversal of metadata-heavy histories.

- Preserve separate FIT elapsed/timer/moving durations and correct moving-time estimates for stationary, missing, rejected and paused data.

## 0.4.0-alpha.6 - 2026-09-07

Verified records, metric explanations and security scanning milestone. Production registration remains closed; operational V1 gates remain open.

- Publish reproducible metric inputs and dashboard model explanations, preserve missing paired output and reject inverted HR thresholds before saving.

- Separate running and cycling record defaults, add all-time/year/period API scopes, exclude future efforts and verify private exclusion/reinstatement without changing local effort data.

- Pin CI actions to verified commit revisions, disable persisted checkout credentials and scan complete Git history with a checksum-verified, redacted Gitleaks release.

## 0.4.0-alpha.5 - 2026-09-07

Verified authentication, archive-integrity and security-policy milestone. Production registration remains closed; this is not operational V1.

- Add nonce-based script CSP through the AuthKit proxy, retain MapLibre workers and required data-service origins, and render each HTML response with a fresh nonce.

- Preserve logout denial before first registration, include identity-owned revocations in export/deletion, and exclude them from older backups using an independent hashed identity deletion marker. Clean up never-registered identities only after confirmed provider deletion.

- Reject damaged ZIP entries with strict header and CRC validation, bounded actual decompression and duplicate-path checks. Preserve migration metadata and retained originals.

- Verify first registration against the live WorkOS identity, preventing an unexpired token from recreating an empty athlete after account deletion. Keep record allocation internal and update the frontend to action transport.

## 0.4.0-alpha.4 - 2026-09-06

Verified sharing boundaries and large XML import milestone. Production remains closed.

- Replace full-tree XML parsing with maintained SAX record parsing, preserve source extensions and recording boundaries, and stream canonical JSON uploads. A hosted 28 MB/300,000-point GPX completed with unchanged original checksum; seven retained staging activities reprocessed with history and edits preserved.

- Rate-limit public share projection atomically to 120 views per link per minute, retain no visitor identifiers and update the share page for mutation transport and retry guidance.

- Align share preview/create validation, deduplicate legacy activity selections, enforce exact expiry, use profile calendar dates and expose selected-field totals with missing measurement counts.

## 0.4.0-alpha.3 - 2026-09-06

Backend recovery, workspace, goal and webhook verification milestone. Production remains closed; provider access and remaining PRD acceptance gates stay open.

- Record private verified Stripe/Resend webhook outcomes and provider failure metrics with OTLP attributes; ignore notifications for absent billing accounts and exclude forged requests from stored observations.

- Review Wahoo, Suunto and COROS access paths against current primary documentation; update disabled connector reasons and send the explicitly approved COROS scope clarification.

- Distinguish missing goal measurements from recorded zero, limit supporting history to the actual calculation cutoff and remove unrelated activity attribution from manual results. Publish goal method revision 1.1.0.

- Add paginated owned workspace and calendar APIs, read only required workspace collections for deterministic analytics, and default custom-query date groups to the athlete's timezone while preserving explicit overrides.

- Recover partial archives through child or whole-archive retries, preserve completed children, page aggregate status scans and fence stale import attempts. Restore interrupted archives as retryable failures and discard stale scan cursors.

## 0.4.0-alpha.2 - 2026-09-06

Verified backend corrections and private measurement APIs. Production remains closed; this is not operational V1 completion.

Versions use Semantic Versioning. Setup and development milestones use prerelease versions. Version 1.0.0 is reserved for complete, operational V1 with recorded verification.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 - 2026-09-06

- Finish live Stripe key issuance after the user's identity verification.
- Configure and verify live EUR 35 monthly and EUR 180 annual subscription prices and the customer portal, with cancellation at period end.
- Save live billing configuration in Vercel production while retaining sandbox resources in development.
- Record implementation-dependent billing and live payment/payout release checks separately from completed account setup. No real charge was made.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - 2026-09-06

- Import the original PRD and strategy brief as product references.
- Add concise repository instructions, explicit user decisions and a setup checklist.
- Establish the Next.js workspace and initial authenticated Convex profile schema.
- Configure development and production Convex, WorkOS and private EU R2 resources, with separate credentials. Verify storage access and environment isolation through APIs.
- Deploy a responsive holding page and health endpoint to kinetexa.com. Keep signup entry points closed until the application is ready.
- Create bounded development/production AI Gateway keys, a Kinetexa PostHog EU project, and a domain-scoped Resend sending key without a plan upgrade.

- Create a separate Stripe account and sandbox, submit live activation using the existing company's details, and configure test subscription prices and customer portal. Live key issuance requires the user's verification.

This is a setup milestone, not a V1 release. Full authentication, activity import, billing lifecycle and desktop/mobile product journeys still require implementation and verification.

## Initial foundation, b08f5d9

- Initialize the public AGPL repository, architecture notes and design direction.
